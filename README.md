# Reco
Creation of my first all time website using django library

### Description of the project 
While following a python web framework, I had to build a website using an HTML / CSS base. 
My idea with Reco was to build a website that helps you to find the perfect film for your next Netflix&Chill. 
It gathers all films / books with detailled information and suitable recomendations. 

Plus, a Ai assistant has been added to find for you the film or book that you need to watch/read base on your feeling.
